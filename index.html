    <h1>Hello and welcome to my bio!</h1>
      <h2>About Me.</h2>
        <p>My name is Jessica Souannhaphanh and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College.</p>
        
        <p>Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience with a variety of design tools, 
          including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and Sketch. </p>
            
        <p> I am passionate about web design, illustration, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, 
          such as motion graphics and typography.</p>

          <h3>Logo Creation</h3>
            <p>
                Your logo is the face of your brand and the first thing that potential customers will see, 
                so it's crucial to make a great first impression. I can help create a logo that is both 
                visually stunning and effective in representing your brand.

            <h3>Web Design</h3>
              <p>

                to make a strong first impression. I can help you create a website that not only looks great but

            <h3>Full Branding</h3>
              <p>
                Your brand is much more than just a logo or a website. It's the overall image that your business 
                presents to the world, including the look, feel, and voice of your brand. I can help you create 
                a cohesive and impactful brand that resonates with your target audience and sets you apart from your competitors.
